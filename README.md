# Barter Buddy
>Android app built for CS360 using React Native, Expo, Express, MySQL

Barter Buddy is a user-friendly marketplace where individuals work
with partners to trade items anonymously through a bulletin board.
Barter Buddy is divided into two sections: Barter Buy and Barter
Sell. A user chooses which account they would like during account
creation and then has access to purchasing or selling items. The
main focus of this app is to properly equate the value of different
items being placed for sell for users as well as abstracting users
so they remain anonymous.
